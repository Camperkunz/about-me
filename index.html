            <h2>Hi, my name is Anna!</h2>
                <p>I'm an International student of Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College.</p>
                <p>I continue my journey of study Web Development. This is the most interesting subject in the program for me. At the moment, I plan to connect my future life with this.</p>

                    <h3>Begining</h3>
                        <p>I was born in a pretty big city in the middle of Siberia — Krasnoyarsk, Russia. I was a really active and creative kid — I made toys from cardboard and imagined a lot of stories in my tiny head.</p>
                        <p>Throughout my whole life, I have been interested in computers. I started learning Adobe Photoshop, Sony Vegas, and Premier Pro when I was 8-10 years old. I liked combining things and creating something new. I experimented a lot.  </p>
                        <p>And the most difficult question for me was — who am I going to be?</p>

                    <h3>Moving in Canada</h3>
                        <p>I'm moved to Canada in July 3, 2023. And I'm still surprised. That was a very spontaneous decision. I thought I'd be in Canada for a month, but thanks to my family, I stayed here for a pretty longer time. I passed the English exam and applied for the IMD program at Algonquin College. And here I am.</p>
                        <p>The first semester was really interesting for me. After the first class of Web Development, I was already determined. That was the missing piece for me. This is exactly what I was looking for. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I'm still practicing and learning. There are still many new things I need to learn, but I'm working hard to become a better version of myself.</p>
